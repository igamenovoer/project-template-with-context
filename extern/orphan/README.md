# Orphan External Dependencies

This directory contains local-only clones and checkouts that are not tracked in git.

Use this for:
- Shallow clones for quick grepping/patching
- Temporary external code references
- Local development dependencies

All subdirectories under `extern/orphan/` should be git-ignored except this README.
